# Vmob Android support

This doc goes trough requirments what it takes to generate C library for Android target.

## JNI

JNI or Java Native Interface is used for Android NDK to communicate with .so library. JNI requires special way of writing C/C++ code that confirms to their rules. JNI uses JNI special types, if we have ```int``` in C, now that becomes ```jInt``` and so on.

Sample of JNI written code:

First we have to generate JavaToC.h file
```c
/* DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - it is machine generated */
#include
/* Header for class JavaToC */

#ifndef _Included_JavaToC
#define _Included_JavaToC
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
/*
* Class:     JavaToC
* Method:    helloC
* Signature: ()V
*/
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_JavaToC_helloC
(JNIEnv *, jobject);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
#endif

```

Then we have to work on C part

```c

#include "JavaToC.h"
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_JavaToC_helloC(JNIEnv *env, jobject javaobj) 
{
	printf("Hello World: From C");
	return;
}

```
We have to then compile this into .so library.
